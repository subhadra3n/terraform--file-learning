1️⃣ Provider & Resource Group
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  name     = "rg-appservice-demo"
  location = "East US"
}

2️⃣ App Service Plan

Explanation: An App Service Plan defines compute resources for your Web App.

resource "azurerm_app_service_plan" "plan" {
  name                = "appservice-plan-demo"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name

  sku {
    tier = "Standard"       # Can be Free, Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, PremiumV3
    size = "S1"             # Size of the plan
  }

  kind = "App"
}


Interview points:

Always mention SKU tiers and why you choose them

“Standard” is minimum for production scaling

3️⃣ App Service (Web App)
resource "azurerm_app_service" "webapp" {
  name                = "webapp-demo-123"  # Must be globally unique
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  app_service_plan_id = azurerm_app_service_plan.plan.id

  https_only = true   # Force HTTPS for security

  site_config {
    always_on = true       # Keep app always running
    ftps_state = "FtpsOnly" # Secure file transfer
  }

  app_settings = {
    "ENVIRONMENT" = "dev"
    "APP_VERSION" = "1.0.0"
  }
}


Interview points to mention:

https_only = true for secure traffic

always_on = true for production apps

app_settings for environment configs

App Service name must be globally unique

4️⃣ Optional: Deployment Slot (for CI/CD)
resource "azurerm_app_service_slot" "staging" {
  name                = "staging"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  app_service_name    = azurerm_app_service.webapp.name

  app_settings = {
    "ENVIRONMENT" = "staging"
  }
}


Interview tip:

Deployment slots allow zero-downtime deployments

Mention it if interviewer asks about CI/CD best practices

5️⃣ Output Web App URL
output "webapp_url" {
  value = azurerm_app_service.webapp.default_site_hostname
}

🔹 Interview Talking Points

App Service Plan = compute tier & SKU

App Service = Web App running in the plan

HTTPS only, FTPS, Always On = production-ready

Slots = staging / production deployments

Can integrate with Private Endpoint, Key Vault, Managed Identity
