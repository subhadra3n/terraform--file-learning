type--Forward, redirect, fixed_response
redirect ---code--
1. type = "redirect"
This action tells the load balancer to redirect the request to another URL or protocol (common use: HTTP â†’ HTTPS redirect).

Example: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

resource "aws_lb_listener" "http" {
  load_balancer_arn = aws_lb.example.arn
  port              = 80
  protocol          = "HTTP"

  default_action {
    type = "redirect"

    redirect {
      port        = "443"
      protocol    = "HTTPS"
      status_code = "HTTP_301"
    }
  }
}
_________________________________________________________----
2.type = "fixed_response
This tells the ALB to immediately return a custom HTTP response without forwarding the request to a target group.

resource "aws_lb_listener" "http" {
  load_balancer_arn = aws_lb.example.arn
  port              = 80
  protocol          = "HTTP"

  default_action {
    type = "fixed-response"

    fixed_response {
      content_type = "text/plain"
      message_body = "Service temporarily unavailable. Please try again later."
      status_code  = "503"
    }
  }
}
