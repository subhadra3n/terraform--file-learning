AWS needs only region because the account is inferred, Azure mandates the features block with subscription context, and GCP strictly requires a project since all resources are project-scoped.”
# AWS Provider
provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"
}

# Azure Provider
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

# GCP Provider
provider "google" {
  project = "my-gcp-project"
  region  = "asia-south1"
}
__________________________________________
provider "google" {
  project = var.gcp_project
  region  = var.gcp_region
}
2️⃣ Via environment variable

export GOOGLE_PROJECT=my-gcp-project

Why features {} is mandatory?

Azure provider requires internal feature toggles

Subscription is usually taken from login context or env vars

🧠 Interview line:

“Azure requires the features {} block even if it’s empty; the subscription acts as the main scope.”
